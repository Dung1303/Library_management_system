## **Library Management System**

Welcome to the Library Management System project. This is a Full-stack web application built with Pure PHP using MVC architecture. It focuses on clean code, practical use, and is easy to expand.


### **Project Introduction**

This project helps manage physical books and borrowing processes. Instead of just managing book titles, the system tracks every physical copy (Book Copies) using Barcodes. This helps the librarian know the exact status of the library inventory.


### **Main Goals:**

Apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to organize code.

Build a clear Permission system between Admin and Member.

Work as a team using the Scrum methodology.


### **Main Features**

For Members (Readers)

Account: Register, login, and manage personal profiles.

Search: View book lists (5-column Grid), search by title/author, and filter by category.


### **For Admin (Librarian)**

Manage Books (CRUD): Manage book titles and every physical copy (book_copies).

Manage Categories: Group books by Technology, Economy, Literature, etc.

Borrow/Return: Approve borrow requests, manage overdue books, and update status via Barcodes.

Manage Members: View member details and lock/unlock accounts.
